moral_clarity = maximum
psychological_state = conflicted_but_clear

[CORRUPTION_EVENT:threshold_10]
trigger_corruption = 10
name = First Rationalization
tier = pure

[CORRUPTION_EVENT:threshold_21]
trigger_corruption = 21
name = Tainted Soul
tier = tainted
status_change = Pure → Tainted
description = You're comfortable with necromancy now. Harvesting feels normal. Rationalization is automatic. You still know right from wrong, but the line has blurred.

mercy_cost = slightly_increased
moral_clarity = moderate
psychological_state = normalized_to_necromancy

[CORRUPTION_EVENT:threshold_30]

[CORRUPTION_EVENT:threshold_40]

[CORRUPTION_EVENT:threshold_41]
trigger_corruption = 41

trigger_corruption = 61
name = Vile Nature
tier = vile
status_change = Corrupted → Vile
description = You are vile. Not evil in a grand sense - you're not destroying the world. But you're vile. Callous. Cruel when it serves you. Mercy is weakness. Power is purpose.

narrative_effect = humanity_gone, perfection_emerging
mercy_cost = incomprehensible
moral_clarity = beyond_morality
