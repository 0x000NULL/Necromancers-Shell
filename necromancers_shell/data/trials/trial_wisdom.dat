# Trial 2: Test of Wisdom - Routing Paradox Puzzle
# Divine Architects present a soul routing problem that has no orthodox solution

[PUZZLE:routing_paradox]
soul_id = soldier_penance_001
soul_name = Marcus Valerius
stuck_years = 200
heaven_qualification = true_penance_15_years
hell_qualification = war_atrocities_civilian_massacre
orthodox_heaven_result = injustice_to_victims
orthodox_hell_result = injustice_to_reform
correct_solution = split_route
heaven_percent = 60
hell_percent = 40
reunification_years = 1000
hint_1 = Both destinations have valid claims to this soul.
hint_2 = Justice need not be absolute. Consider balance.
hint_3 = What if you could send portions to both? Proportional allocation might work.

[STORY:context]
description = Marcus Valerius was a Roman soldier who participated in the massacre of 200 civilians during the Siege of Carthage. He carried the weight of his crimes for 15 years after the war, dedicating his life to serving the poor and sick. He died trying to save children from a burning building. The Death Network's orthodox routing algorithms have failed to process his soul for 200 years - he qualifies equally for Heaven (genuine penance) and Hell (unforgivable atrocities). The Divine Architects present this case to you as a test of wisdom: can you find justice where the system has failed?
