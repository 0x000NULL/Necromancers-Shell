[STORY:context]
description = The Chamber of Corrupted Souls is a place between worlds where the most vile and twisted souls await judgment. Spending time here exposes you to their malice, their pain, their endless rage. The corruption seeps into you slowly, day by day, wearing down your resistance. Daily temptations whisper of easy power - just a little more corruption for immense strength. The Divine Architects watch to see if you can endure constant pressure without breaking. Can you resist the easy path when it's offered every single day? This is the test of resolve.
