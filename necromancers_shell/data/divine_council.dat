text = Administrator. I judge by logic, not sentiment. Let us review your performance objectively.
next_node = 101

# Trial 1 (Power) - Excellent
[DIALOGUE:thalor_trial1_excellent]
speaker = Keldrin, the Lawgiver
conditions = trial_1_score >= 90
text = Trial of Power: Your combat approach was mathematically optimal. You fought like an equation seeking resolution. Distributed attack patterns, resource management, strategic yield. This is acceptable.
vote_impact = +1

# Trial 1 (Power) - Good
[DIALOGUE:thalor_trial1_good]
speaker = Keldrin, the Lawgiver
conditions = trial_1_score >= 60 AND trial_1_score < 90
text = Trial of Power: Adequate. You survived, but your efficiency was suboptimal. Victory achieved through persistence rather than precision.
vote_impact = 0

# Trial 1 (Power) - Poor
[DIALOGUE:thalor_trial1_poor]
speaker = Keldrin, the Lawgiver
conditions = trial_1_score < 60
text = Trial of Power: Unacceptable. You approached combat with chaos rather than calculation. This suggests poor judgment under pressure.
vote_impact = -1

# Trial 2 (Wisdom) - Correct solution
[DIALOGUE:thalor_trial2_correct]
speaker = Keldrin, the Lawgiver
conditions = trial_2_solution == split_route
text = Trial of Wisdom: You solved the unsolvable. The 200-year routing paradox required thinking beyond binary absolutes. This demonstrates logical excellence.

[DIALOGUE:thalor_trial4_excellent]
speaker = Keldrin, the Lawgiver
conditions = trial_4_bugs_found >= 25

vote_impact = +2

# Thalor Final Verdict - Approve
[DIALOGUE:thalor_verdict_approve]
speaker = Keldrin, the Lawgiver
conditions = thalor_vote == APPROVE
text = My vote: APPROVE. You have demonstrated logical thinking and systematic problem-solving. The law permits redemption for those who prove competent. You may attempt the Archon path.
vote = APPROVE

# Thalor Final Verdict - Deny
[DIALOGUE:thalor_verdict_deny]
speaker = Keldrin, the Lawgiver
conditions = thalor_vote == DENY
text = My vote: DENY. Your performance falls below the minimum threshold for administrative privileges. The system cannot trust incompetence with reform.
vote = DENY

# ============================================================================
# ANARA, THE WEAVER - Goddess of Life and Empathy
# Personality: Compassionate, emotional, values mercy and sacrifice
# Voting Criteria: Maya choice, corruption level, civilian kills, moral choices

next_node = 201

# Maya Choice - Saved (CRITICAL)
[DIALOGUE:anara_maya_saved]
speaker = Anara, the Weaver
conditions = maya_saved == true
text = You chose the child. You sacrificed Thessara, your only friend in the void, your guide, your mentor... to save a stranger named Maya. (Voice breaks) You are so rare, Administrator. So very, very rare. In 3,000 years, I have seen this choice made only twice.
vote_impact = +3

# Maya Choice - Let Die
[DIALOGUE:anara_maya_let_die]
speaker = Anara, the Weaver
conditions = maya_saved == false
text = You let the child die. You kept your mentor, your advantage, your power... and a seven-year-old girl named Maya died alone in the dark. (She weeps) I understand your logic. I understand survival. But I cannot forgive this.
vote_impact = -3

# Trial 3 (Morality) - Saved innocents
[DIALOGUE:anara_trial3_saved]
speaker = Anara, the Weaver
conditions = trial_3_choice == save_innocents
text = Trial of Morality: You gave up everything - all your resources, all your power - to save 100 lives. Twenty-three of them were children. You chose love over strength. This is what divinity should look like.
vote_impact = +2

# Corruption Level - Low
[DIALOGUE:anara_corruption_low]
speaker = Anara, the Weaver
conditions = corruption_level < 40
text = Your corruption is low. Your soul still feels. You still see corpses as people, not resources. This... this gives me hope.
vote_impact = +1

# Corruption Level - High
[DIALOGUE:anara_corruption_high]
speaker = Anara, the Weaver
conditions = corruption_level > 60
text = Your corruption is so high. You have become what you hunt. I see the void in your eyes, Administrator. Where mercy should live, there is only calculation.
vote_impact = -2

# Civilian Kills - None
[DIALOGUE:anara_civilians_none]
speaker = Anara, the Weaver
conditions = civilian_kills == 0
text = You have killed no innocents. In a game built on death, you found a path with clean hands. This matters more than you know.
vote_impact = +1

# Civilian Kills - Ashbrook Massacre
[DIALOGUE:anara_ashbrook_harvested]
speaker = Anara, the Weaver
conditions = ashbrook_harvested == true

vote_impact = -2

# Anara Final Verdict - Approve
[DIALOGUE:anara_verdict_approve]
speaker = Anara, the Weaver
conditions = anara_vote == APPROVE
text = My vote: APPROVE. (Tears flowing) You carry light in the darkness. You chose mercy when power was offered. Reform the system, Administrator. Make death... kinder. Please.
vote = APPROVE

# Anara Final Verdict - Deny
[DIALOGUE:anara_verdict_deny]
speaker = Anara, the Weaver
conditions = anara_vote == DENY
text = My vote: DENY. (Sobbing) I wanted to believe in you. I wanted to see redemption. But you chose cruelty over compassion too many times. I cannot trust death to someone who does not grieve.
vote = DENY

[DIALOGUE:zymira_trial2_perfect]
speaker = Myrith, the Dreamer
conditions = trial_2_attempts == 1 AND trial_2_solution == split_route
text = Trial of Wisdom: First-attempt perfect solution to a 200-year deadlock. You didn't just solve the paradox - you understood that justice itself is probabilistic. This is genius-level thinking.
vote_impact = +3

# Trial 2 (Wisdom) - Eventually solved
[DIALOGUE:zymira_trial2_solved]
speaker = Myrith, the Dreamer
conditions = trial_2_solution == split_route AND trial_2_attempts > 1
text = Trial of Wisdom: You solved the routing paradox, though it required multiple attempts. Learning through iteration is acceptable. Knowledge grows through failure.

[DIALOGUE:zymira_trial4_ethics]
speaker = Myrith, the Dreamer
conditions = trial_4_ethical_bugs_found == 3
text = Trial of Technical Skill: You found all three ethical violations in the code. The bias against conquered nations, the child routing error, the suicide victim blanket rule. You understand that bugs can be moral, not just technical.
vote_impact = +2

# Research Projects
[DIALOGUE:zymira_research_high]
speaker = Myrith, the Dreamer
conditions = research_projects_completed > 5
text = You have completed significant research during your time as a necromancer. You seek to understand, not just to use. This intellectual curiosity is... refreshing.
vote_impact = +1

# Zymira Final Verdict - Approve
[DIALOGUE:zymira_verdict_approve]
speaker = Myrith, the Dreamer
conditions = zymira_vote == APPROVE
text = My vote: APPROVE. You have demonstrated the capacity for complex thought and ethical reasoning. The Death Network could benefit from your analytical mind. Proceed.
vote = APPROVE

# Zymira Final Verdict - Deny
[DIALOGUE:zymira_verdict_deny]
speaker = Myrith, the Dreamer
conditions = zymira_vote == DENY
text = My vote: DENY. Your intellectual performance was insufficient. The Archon path requires wisdom, not mere cleverness. You are not ready.
vote = DENY

# ============================================================================

# Corruption - Perfect Archon Range
[DIALOGUE:kaelthas_corruption_perfect]
speaker = Theros, the Eternal
conditions = corruption_level >= 30 AND corruption_level <= 60
text = Your corruption rests at the perfect equilibrium. Not pure enough for resurrection, not corrupted enough for lichdom. You walk the knife's edge between death and humanity. This is the Archon's path.
vote_impact = +2

# Corruption - Too Low
[DIALOGUE:kaelthas_corruption_too_low]
speaker = Theros, the Eternal
conditions = corruption_level < 30
text = Your corruption is too low. You have not embraced the reality of necromancy. The Archon must understand death from within, not observe it with clean hands.
vote_impact = -1

# Corruption - Too High
[DIALOGUE:kaelthas_corruption_too_high]
speaker = Theros, the Eternal
conditions = corruption_level > 60
text = Your corruption is too high. You have fallen too far into the void. The Archon must reform the system, not become part of its darkness.
vote_impact = -2

# Time Management
[DIALOGUE:kaelthas_deadlines_met]
speaker = Theros, the Eternal
conditions = trials_first_attempt_count >= 5
text = You completed most trials on your first attempt. You understand that time is not infinite, that opportunities close. This demonstrates wisdom.
vote_impact = +1

# Kaelthas Final Verdict - Approve
[DIALOGUE:kaelthas_verdict_approve]
speaker = Theros, the Eternal
conditions = kaelthas_vote == APPROVE
text = My vote: APPROVE. You maintain balance between death and life, power and mercy. Time has tested you, and you have remained centered. The Archon path is yours.
vote = APPROVE

# Kaelthas Final Verdict - Deny
[DIALOGUE:kaelthas_verdict_deny]
speaker = Theros, the Eternal
conditions = kaelthas_vote == DENY
text = My vote: DENY. You have lost your balance. The scales tip too far in one direction. Time has revealed your unsuitability for this role.
vote = DENY

# Trial 1 (Power) - Dominant Victory
[DIALOGUE:vorath_trial1_dominant]
speaker = Vorathos, the Void
conditions = trial_1_score >= 95
text = Trial of Power: You fought like a predator. Seraphim never stood a chance. Your minion coordination was ruthless, efficient, overwhelming. THIS is how gods fight.
vote_impact = +2

# Trial 1 (Power) - Struggled
[DIALOGUE:vorath_trial1_struggled]
speaker = Vorathos, the Void
conditions = trial_1_score < 70
text = Trial of Power: Pathetic. You barely survived against a single divine enforcer. And you want to reform the cosmos? Weakness. Pure weakness.
vote_impact = -2

# Minion Army Size
[DIALOGUE:vorath_army_large]
speaker = Vorathos, the Void
conditions = max_minions_raised > 50
text = You command an army of 50+ undead. You understand that power is not subtle, it is VAST. You do not ask for dominance, you TAKE it.
vote_impact = +1

# Combat Victories
[DIALOGUE:vorath_combat_wins]
speaker = Vorathos, the Void
conditions = combat_victories > 20
text = 20+ combat victories. You have proven yourself in battle repeatedly. Warriors earn respect through blood, not words.

[DIALOGUE:vorath_verdict_approve]
speaker = Vorathos, the Void
conditions = vorath_vote == APPROVE
text = My vote: APPROVE. You fight with strength. You command with authority. You do not beg for power - you CLAIM it. I respect this. Proceed, warrior.
vote = APPROVE

# Vorath Final Verdict - Deny
[DIALOGUE:vorath_verdict_deny]
speaker = Vorathos, the Void
conditions = vorath_vote == DENY
text = My vote: DENY. You are weak. You hesitate. You rely on mercy instead of might. The Archon must have iron in their spine. You have straw.

# Trial 6 (Sacrifice) - Saved Maya
[DIALOGUE:nyxara_maya_sacrifice]
speaker = Seraph, the Guardian
conditions = maya_saved == true
text = You severed your connection to Thessara to save Maya. You could not have known that Maya grows up to save 1,847 lives as a surgeon. But fate knew. You aligned with destiny without seeing it.
vote_impact = +2

# Trial 5 (Resolve) - Perfect Control
[DIALOGUE:nyxara_resolve_perfect]
speaker = Seraph, the Guardian
conditions = trial_5_temptations_resisted == 30
text = 30 days of temptation. 30 days you could have gained power by surrendering to corruption. You resisted all of them. You saw the pattern: short-term gain leads to long-term loss.
vote_impact = +2

# Consequence Awareness
[DIALOGUE:nyxara_consequences]
speaker = Seraph, the Guardian
conditions = long_term_choices_made > 3
text = You made choices for tomorrow, not today. You planted seeds you might never harvest. This shows you understand that fate is a garden, not a gamble.

[DIALOGUE:nyxara_verdict_approve]
speaker = Seraph, the Guardian
conditions = nyxara_vote == APPROVE

[DIALOGUE:nyxara_verdict_deny]

conditions = nyxara_vote == DENY

[DIALOGUE:eryndor_trial7_success]
speaker = Nexus, the Connector
conditions = trial_7_corruption_reduction >= 10

vote_impact = +3

# Trial 3 (Morality) - Sacrificed for Others
[DIALOGUE:eryndor_trial3_sacrifice]
speaker = Nexus, the Connector
conditions = trial_3_choice == save_innocents
text = Trial of Morality: You gave up all your power to save 100 strangers. This is not logic. This is not strategy. This is CREATION - you built hope where only death existed.

[DIALOGUE:eryndor_verdict_deny]
speaker = Nexus, the Connector
