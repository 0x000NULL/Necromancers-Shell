# Trigger Event
trigger_event = Azrael (later known as Kael) attempted the Morningstar Transformation
trigger_description = First successful godhood attempt by a mortal necromancer. Azrael completed all seven trials and transcended to divine status, becoming the Eighth Architect. The existing Seven viewed this as an existential threat to divine order.
trigger_corruption = 50.00%
trigger_civilian_deaths = 0

# Divine Response
divine_vote = unanimous
divine_decision = Total annihilation of all necromancers to prevent future ascension attempts
divine_justification = Mortal ascension destabilizes cosmic balance. One breach creates precedent for infinite breaches.
response_speed_days = 7

# Outcomes
survival_method = Geographic isolation in Frozen Wastes, beyond enforcer patrol range
civilian_casualties = 2340
collateral_damage = Entire city of Valdris destroyed (12,000 dead)
territory_lost = 23 necromancer strongholds razed
artifacts_destroyed = 147 necromantic tomes burned
knowledge_lost = Apotheosis Engine blueprints, Morningstar trial documentation

# Historical Significance
lesson_learned = Godhood attempts trigger unanimous divine wrath
precedent_established = Code Prohibition #1: No necromancer may seek deification
cultural_impact = Necromancer population scattered, communities destroyed
theological_impact = Proved that mortal→divine transcendence is possible but forbidden
long_term_effect = 2,100 years of suppression, Azrael/Kael erased from history

# Survivors
survivor_count = 3
survivor_names = Vorgath (age 127), Seraphine (age 89), 10 others unnamed
survivor_fate = Founded hidden enclaves, taught survival through obscurity
survivor_strategy = Never draw divine attention, stay below 100 total necromancers

# Divine Aftermath
divine_satisfaction = complete
archon_position_created = false
reformation_program = none
restrictions_imposed = Total ban on ascension research

notes = The First Purge established the pattern: divine response to necromantic threat is overwhelming and immediate. Survival rate of 1.33% became the baseline expectation for divine intervention. Azrael's name was erased from history, replaced with the title "Kael" (The Damned One). His success proved the Morningstar path is REAL, but forbidden.

# SECOND PURGE: THE PLAGUE OF UNDEATH

survival_rate = 0%

# Divine Forces Deployed
enforcers_deployed = seraphim:30, inevitable:15, hellknight:20
enforcer_casualties = 8
divine_manifestations = 1

# Trigger Event
trigger_event = Regional Council spread necrotic plague to 12 kingdoms
trigger_description = Coordinated attack by all 89 necromancers to turn 89,000 civilians into undead slaves. Plan was to force kingdoms to acknowledge necromancers as "gods of death" and grant worship rights. Backfired catastrophically.
trigger_corruption = 76%
trigger_civilian_deaths = 89000

# Divine Response
divine_vote = 6 approve, 1 abstain
divine_decision = Extermination of all plague-spreading necromancers
divine_justification = Mass civilian casualties crossed the intervention threshold. Anara abstained due to grief.
response_speed_days = 14

# Outcomes
survival_method = Early surrender (23 necromancers), fleeing to outer planes (64 necromancers)
civilian_casualties = 89000
collateral_damage = 12 kingdoms quarantined for 3 years
territory_lost = 47 necromancer territories destroyed
artifacts_destroyed = 234 plague artifacts burned
knowledge_lost = Necrotic plague formula (intentionally purged)

# Historical Significance
lesson_learned = Mass civilian casualties trigger divine intervention regardless of intent
precedent_established = Civilian death threshold: ~10,000+ deaths in short timeframe
cultural_impact = Necromancers learned to avoid large-scale visible attacks
theological_impact = Anara's abstention showed gods are not monolithic
long_term_effect = Shift from overt power displays to covert operations

# Survivors
survivor_count = 0
survivor_method = Early surrender (23) + Planar flight (64, but 40 died in outer planes)
survivor_fate = Surrendered necromancers were imprisoned for 50 years, then released
survivor_strategy = Avoid mass casualties, work in shadows

# Divine Aftermath
divine_satisfaction = moderate
archon_position_created = false
reformation_program = none
restrictions_imposed = Ban on plague magic, civilian kill count monitoring

notes = Second Purge showed higher survival rate (8.98% vs 1.33%) because some necromancers surrendered before being killed. This established that EARLY SURRENDER can work. Also proved that fleeing to outer planes is possible but high-mortality (40 of 64 fled died in hostile realms). Divine vote was not unanimous - Anara abstained, showing cracks in divine unity.

# ============================================================================
# THIRD PURGE: THE CORRUPTION PURGE
# Year: -104 (104 years before current timeline)
# Trigger: Regional Council collective corruption exceeded 85%
# ============================================================================

[PURGE:third]
id = 3
number = 3
year = -600
name = The Corruption Purge
alternative_names = The Redemption Trial, The First Reformation
duration_days = 45
status = historical

# Population Statistics
population_before = 156

survival_rate = 17%

# Divine Forces Deployed
enforcers_deployed = seraphim:15, inevitable:10, hellknight:5
enforcer_casualties = 2
divine_manifestations = 0

# Trigger Event
trigger_event = Regional Council reached 85% average corruption
trigger_description = Not a single catastrophic event, but gradual slide toward collective damnation. Council members enabled each other's descent. No mass casualties, but philosophical threat to cosmic order.
trigger_corruption = 85%
trigger_civilian_deaths = 1200

# Divine Response
divine_vote = 5 approve, 2 oppose
divine_decision = Targeted purge of high-corruption necromancers, offer reformation to those below 70%
divine_justification = Corruption itself is contagious. Must prune the infected before total rot. Anara and Eryndor opposed, arguing for pure reformation.
response_speed_days = 30

# Outcomes
survival_method = Reformation program (23), surrender (21), flight (32), hiding (13)
civilian_casualties = 1200
collateral_damage = 3 necromancer academies closed
territory_lost = 28 territories abandoned
artifacts_destroyed = 89 corruption-inducing artifacts
knowledge_lost = None (knowledge preserved intentionally)

# Historical Significance
lesson_learned = Corruption thresholds matter; reformation is possible below 70%
precedent_established = First purge with reformed survivors - proves change is possible
cultural_impact = 23 reformed necromancers formed the Ethics Council
theological_impact = Proved Anara and Eryndor's argument: mercy can work
long_term_effect = Survival rate jumped to 26%, showing cooperation with gods is viable

# Survivors
survivor_count = 27
survivor_breakdown = reformed:10, surrendered:8, fled:6, hidden:3
survivor_fate = Reformed 23 founded Ethics Council and taught responsible necromancy
survivor_strategy = Accept divine oversight, maintain corruption below 70%, cooperate

# Divine Aftermath
divine_satisfaction = moderate
archon_position_created = false
reformation_program = yes_experimental
restrictions_imposed = Corruption monitoring, mandatory reporting, ethics training

notes = Third Purge was REVOLUTIONARY. For the first time, gods offered reformation instead of pure extermination. 23 necromancers chose to work WITH the divine, reducing corruption through ethical practice. They formed the Ethics Council which still exists today. Survival rate of 26% (vs 8.98% and 1.33% previously) proved that cooperation is the optimal strategy. Anara and Eryndor's advocacy for mercy paid off - they were RIGHT. This purge created the philosophical foundation for the Archon path.

# Trigger Event
trigger_event = Ashbrook massacre on Day 47 (if player harvested)
trigger_description = Player's actions at Ashbrook (147 civilians harvested or spared) combined with Regional Council's corruption level (average 73%) triggered divine attention. If player harvested Ashbrook, it accelerated purge timeline from 5 years to 1.5 years.

# Divine Aftermath (Projected)
divine_satisfaction_archon = high
archon_position_created = yes
reformation_program = comprehensive
restrictions_imposed = Code of Conduct, corruption caps, regular reporting

notes = The Fourth Purge is UNIQUE - it's the first where a mortal (the player) has the power to fundamentally change the outcome. If the player completes the Archon trials, they can reform ALL 147 remaining necromancers and achieve a 66% survival rate - the highest in history. This would prove the Third Purge's reformation experiment can scale. Alternatively, if the player fails or refuses the Archon path, this purge could be the most deadly yet (total extinction of necromancers). The player is literally the deciding factor in whether necromancy survives or dies forever.

# Lessons Learned
lesson_1 = Never pursue godhood (certain death)
lesson_2 = Avoid mass civilian casualties (triggers intervention)
lesson_3 = Corruption below 70% allows reformation
lesson_4 = Cooperation with gods is optimal survival strategy

# Key Insight
# Each purge has shown HIGHER survival rates as necromancers learn to work
# WITH divine order rather than against it. The Fourth Purge could be the
# culmination of this trend - total integration via Archon system, or the
# final failure leading to permanent extinction.
#
# The player decides which ending history records.
